# janya-ragas
854 Carnatic janya ragas expressed in the form of interval ratios, in .scl files. 

# a word on the directory structure
janya ragas are child ragas, variations on the fundamental 72 melakarta ragas. each directory is thus the name of a parent raga, and the files within are its children. Some have none, some have many.

# several big issues
the vast majority of the files are usable. 
the exceptions:
1. janya ragas with many different versions are missing,  a few have 5 or 6 different variations that didn't get translated correctly. processing issues. I will get to them within the week.
2. the ascending / descending part of the patterns. not sure whether to repeat the tonic at the top of the scale, and it would seem that Scala has no built-in way of handling ascending vs. descending modes.

# intended purpose
the intended purpose of these files is to bring this particular collection of ragas to the .scl format. The original goal was to benefit modular synthesizer users who require concise and well-organized .scl files to sequence notes.
