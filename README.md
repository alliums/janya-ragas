# janya-ragas
854 Carnatic Janya Ragas expressed in the form of interval ratios, in .scl files.

# Currently in good order!
or so it seems...
Certain files are missing, in particular there are a few Janya Ragas with 5 or 6 different variations. My program cannot handle those, so I have to go back and do them manually. For now, you're stuck with this meager collection of 854 Carnatic modes. I hope you enjoy :)

# Intended purpose
The intended purpose of these files is to bring this particular collection of ragas to the .scl format. The original goal was to benefit modular synthesizer users who require concise and well-organized .scl files to sequence notes.

Long live open source!
